Aim: To understand the joint trajectories in the condition number of reg mat

Config params: Sensor is placed at [-0.2; -0.3; 0].

Procedure: A planar 3-link system is taken for analysis. 
Two cases of joint trajectories are considered. Both move in the same 
direction in the first case and in the reverse direction in the second case. 
Condition number of reg mat in each case is compared to that where both 
reg mats are concatanated.

Observation: In cases 1 & 2, even though the base was excited along all the
three directions and joints moved along their axis, reg mat was ill-conditioned. 
Just by concatnating reg mats, the cond num redued 10^6 times.

Conclusion: It is desirable to minimize the condition number even though
an initial guess of the parameters is required. Above results suggests that,
optimization is necessary to reduce cond num from such high orders only 
and not for micro optimization. So, even an extremely off parameters shouldn't
be an issue to reduce cond num by so many levels.
